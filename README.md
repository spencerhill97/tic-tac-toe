# Tic Tac Toe

This project is a simple user vs computer Tic Tac Toe game. It's a single game of Tic Tac Toe and allows the user to play again and let's the user know who won. I built this game with intent on developing better understanding of Factory Functions and the Module Pattern. I was not as worried about the UI with this game as I was with just implementing what I learned.
